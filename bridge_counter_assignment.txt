Assignment:

Create a program that can calculate bridge scores . . . 

A bridge hand contains thirteen cards. 

Ace = 4 points ea, 
King = 3 points ea, 
queen = 2 points ea,
Jack = 1 point ea,

*all other cards have no point value 

"distribution" points:

Two cards of a particular suit = 1 extra point.
"Singleton," (only one card of a particular suit) = 2 extra points. 
A "void,'' (no cards in a particular suit) = 3 extra points.
